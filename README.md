# scordify19 #
## Automatic convertion of Lilypoind scores for 19EDO performance ##
Scordify19 is a program to transcribe a score composed in 19-EDO and engraved
in Lilypond so that it can performed on a _scordatura keyboard_
(which is to say, one in which the 19 tones of the octave are mapped
onto a conventional keyboard by retuning it).
